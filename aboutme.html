                <p>As a young developer, I'm passionate about becoming a great developer and have been improving my skills for the past years. While I've encountered numerous failed projects, I'm determined to keep pushing until I achieve my goals.</p>
                <p>I've trained in several areas, including economy, database, keycard systems, game passes, and more. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me directly on Discord.</p>
                <p>I'll do my best to deliver high-quality work that meets your expectations, and we can discuss payment and other details through direct messaging.</p>
                <p>Please keep in mind that I'm still young and have school, so if I ever fall short of your expectations, kindly let me know, and I will do my best to make things right.</p>
                <p>In conclusion I will try my best to meet your expectations</p>
